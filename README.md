# EHJ_Lead_in_Children
Group Project for the class "Environmental Health Justice"

Sept 2019: There are three data sets in the Data file that may be used for the project. Children_tested... and Free_residential... are downloaded directly from NYC Open Data. Under_6_BLL_cleaned is a modified data set from NYC Open data. 
In main.py, currently, the under_6_bll_cleaned data set is being entered. A graph comparing the BLL rates in the 5 boroughs from 2005-2016. 

Currently: The project's focus has shifted from chidlren with lead to lead in top soil in NYC. In the folder "Brooklyn Soil Map", there is a map of brooklyn that shows the avrage lead level when hovered over. This data is currently not completely accurate as I don't have access to the source, only the GIS map made: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-70557-6_9
